## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.

var schooling = 18

//:  Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
schooling = 19

//:  Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
 print("yes. It's different because this is a var, a variable that can be changed and updated. 'let' cannot be changed, they are constant")
