/*:
## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours

let userName = "Fred"
print("userName is a constant because names don't tend to change")
var userAge = 0
print("userAge is a variable because age changes yearly")
var numSteps = 0
print("numSteps is a variable because steps increase throughout the day")
let gaolSteps = 10000
print("goalSteps is a constant because its the goal number needs to stay the same")
let aveHearRt = 80
print("aveHeartRt average heart rate will change constantly")

/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
